# WaveformView iOS

A UIView subclass, in Swift, that reproduces the waveform effect seen in Siri on iOS 7 and 8.

Originally a Swift and iOS port of [SISinusWaveView](https://github.com/raffael/SISinusWaveView) that also removed the requirement of `EZAudio`. There is also a [WaveformView for macOS](https://github.com/jyunderwood/WaveformView-macOS) that shares most of the same code. This project includes a simple demo application but it's also used in the example application [Talkboy for iOS](https://github.com/jyunderwood/Talkboy-iOS).
